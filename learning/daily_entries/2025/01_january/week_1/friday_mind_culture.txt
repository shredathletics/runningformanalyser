   - Shows how different scripts evolved
   - Great visuals of various writing systems

Recommended Viewing Order:
1. Start with Lera Boroditsky's TED Talk (foundation concepts)
2. Watch SciShow's brain science video (biological perspective)
3. Move to Vsauce for deeper cognitive effects
4. Explore NativLang for writing system evolution
5. Finish with BBC Documentary for historical context

**Online Articles:**
1. "How Writing Changed the World" by Bridget Alex
   - Published in Discover Magazine
   - Link: discover.com/writing-changed-world

2. "The Cognitive Revolution of Written Language" by Stanislas Dehaene
   - Published in Scientific American
   - Focuses on neuroscience of reading and writing

**Interactive Resources:**
- British Museum's "Writing Through Time" interactive timeline
- UNESCO's "Memory of the World" digital archive
- University of Chicago's Oriental Institute virtual museum tour

### Key Questions to Explore
1. How did the invention of writing change human memory patterns?
2. What cognitive abilities emerged with literacy?
3. How does external memory storage affect thinking?
4. What parallels exist between ancient and modern cognitive tools?

### Connection to Previous Learning (Mesopotamia)
- Link cuneiform development to cognitive changes
- Compare ancient record-keeping to modern memory aids
- Explore how organized writing led to organized thinking

## Learning Breakdown

### 1. Basic Concept: External Memory
- Writing serves as the first "external hard drive" for human memory
- Before writing: all knowledge had to be memorized
- After writing: information could be stored outside the brain
- This freed up mental space for other thinking

### 2. How Writing Changes Thinking
- Allows for more complex thought chains
- Enables review and revision of ideas
- Creates permanent records vs. oral traditions
- Supports systematic thinking and organization

### 3. Brain Adaptations
- Reading and writing are not "natural" brain functions
- Brain repurposes visual and language areas
- New neural pathways form when learning to read
- Different writing systems activate different brain patterns

### 4. Cognitive Benefits
- Enhanced memory organization
- Improved abstract thinking
- Better sequential processing
- Stronger analytical skills
- More structured problem-solving

### 5. Modern Implications
- Digital tools changing how we process information
- New forms of external memory (smartphones, computers)
- Evolution of communication methods
- Impact on attention and memory

Let's start with understanding these basic concepts before moving to more complex ideas.

## Evening Reflection
[January 24, 2025 Evening]

### Today's Achievement
- Explored how different languages shape different thinking patterns
- Learned about concrete examples of language affecting cognition
- Connected writing systems to cognitive development
- Understood the concept of external memory storage

### Key Concepts Learned
1. **Language-Cognition Connection**
   - Different languages create different thinking patterns
   - Examples:
     - Mandarin (no future tense) → better savings habits
     - Pirahã (limited numbers) → different mathematical thinking
     - Russian (two blues) → faster color discrimination

2. **Writing as External Memory**
   - Writing systems serve as cognitive tools
   - Free up mental space for other thinking
   - Enable more complex thought chains
   - Allow knowledge accumulation across generations

3. **Brain Adaptations**
   - Reading/writing repurpose existing brain areas
   - Different writing systems activate different patterns
   - Brain shows plasticity in adapting to symbolic thinking

### Knowledge Integration
- Connected to Mesopotamian writing development
- Linked language effects to economic behavior
- Related writing systems to cognitive evolution
- Connected ancient memory systems to modern digital tools

### Emotional Check-in
- Fascinated by how language shapes thought
- Excited about connections between different topics
- Curious about implications for modern technology
- Engaged with real-world examples

### Questions Generated
1. How might emoji and visual language change our thinking?
2. Could different writing systems develop different cognitive strengths?
3. How is digital technology changing our memory patterns?
4. What cognitive abilities might emerge from new communication tools?
