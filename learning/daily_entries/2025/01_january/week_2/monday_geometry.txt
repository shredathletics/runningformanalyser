## Today's Practice Session - Level 1 Pattern Recognition
Time Started: [Current Time]

### Basic Shape Repetition Exercises

**Warm-up Exercise:**
1. Simple Pattern Recognition
   - Square → Triangle → Circle → Square → Triangle → [?]
   - Circle → Circle → Square → Circle → Circle → [?]
   - Triangle → Square → Square → Triangle → Square → [?]

2. Pattern Completion Task:
```
⬡ ⬢ ⬡ ⬢ ⬡ [?]
□ ○ □ ○ □ [?]
△ ▲ △ ▲ △ [?]
```

3. Shape Sequence Analysis:
```
Series A: ◇ → ◆ → ◇ → ◆ → [?] → [?]
Series B: ○ → ● → ● → ○ → [?] → [?]
Series C: △ → ▲ → △ → ▲ → [?] → [?]
```

**Practice Steps:**
1. Observe each pattern for 30 seconds
2. Write down the pattern rule
3. Predict the next two shapes
4. Check your answers
5. Note any patterns in your thinking process

**Next Steps:**
- Once comfortable with basic patterns, move to:
  * Pattern Shape: https://toytheater.com/pattern-shape/
  * Start with "Basic Patterns" level
  * Complete 5 exercises
  * Record your observations

**Progress Tracking:**
□ Completed warm-up exercises
□ Identified pattern rules
□ Practiced with online tool
□ Ready for Level 2

Notes:
Pattern 1 Analysis:
- Sequence: Square → Triangle → Circle → Square → Triangle → [Circle]
- Pattern Rule: Repeating sequence of three shapes (Square, Triangle, Circle)
- Observation: This is a cyclic pattern with a period of 3
- Application: Similar to many natural cycles and traditional designs

Next Pattern to Solve:
Circle → Circle → Square → Circle → Circle → [?]
- Look for: Number of repetitions before change
- Consider: Is this a different type of pattern structure?

Progress:
✓ Solved Pattern 1
□ Pattern 2 in progress
□ Pattern 3 pending
□ Ready for Pattern Completion Task

Your turn: What do you think comes next in Pattern 2?
Hint: Look at how many circles appear before the square.
